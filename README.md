# IPL-Winner-Predictor
We created the IPL Winner Predictor project by analyzing previous year's data from 2008 to 2019 using logistic regression to predict the winner of the IPL. The model was deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to select the teams and venue for the match and view the predicted winner.

The project successfully predicted IPL winners and showed the potential of machine learning in sports analysis and prediction. To improve the model further, additional data such as team composition, player performance, and injuries could be incorporated.

Overall, the IPL Winner Predictor project demonstrated the value of machine learning and data analysis in the context of sports prediction.
